# February 13, 2021 - Next week's assignments are posted.

Hello Again CMSE401 Students,

I just finished updating the course website and the student git repository with new assignments for next week.  These changes include the new quiz and homework schedule (basically I swapped them out.  Please have a look and make sure I didn't miss anything.

Take care and see you on Monday,

# February 12th, 2021 - Assignment Schedule Changes are coming

Hello CMSE401 Students,

As I am preparing to post next weeks assignments, I realized that we are not far enough along for you to finish the OpenMP homework (HW2) which I had scheduled to be due next Thursday (February 18).  Although all of you should have no problem doing the serial benchmarking,  I don't feel we have had enough practice with OMP for loops and SLURM scheduling.   

Unfortunately, I don't feel like we can easily skip a week which will throw off my schedule completely.  Therefore, I am going to rearrange the schedule a bit as follows:

* First, Nothing will be due next Thursday February 18th.  The Homework will now be due February 25th instead.

* Second, I plan on moving Quiz2 from February 26 to next Friday February 19.  Quizzes are worth much less of your final grade and I can target the quiz on what we have covered.  

* Finally, I will then probably just swap the quiz due dates with the homeworks for the rest of the semester (assuming the topics line up okay). 

These changes will actually take quite a bit of schedule fiddling on my end.  I will not be able to get them done tonight and it may take me much of the weekend (I also need to grade your project proposals).  I will let everyone know when I am finished.  Please be patient and let me know as soon as possible if you have an concerns regarding this plan.

One final note, I don't plan to change the pre-class assignments for next week. Therefore I will get them posted tonight so you can work on them as well. 

Take care,

- Dirk
