Hello CMSE401 students,

I thought class went well today.  Hopefully you all are working on the Homework which is due on Thursday.  I just uploaded all of next weeks in-class and pre-class assignments and finished editing the videos of your questions for today:

# January 21, 2021 - Prerequisite changes

Hello CMSE401 Students,

I wanted all of you to know that the CMSE "Undergraduate studies committee" has agreed to change the prerequisites for this course.  Now students are only required to have Calculus II (including either MTH 133, the Honors version of calc II and the "Survey of Calculus" class) and a C/C++ course (like CSE232). The course will no longer require Calculus 4.  

Although these changes will not become official until next time CMSE401 is taught, I will be rewriting all of the assignments to reflect these new requirements.  We will continue to use examples that take advantage of multi-variable calculus you learned in Calculus 4 however these examples will not require that you have taken Calculus 4. I will review and cover all of the math necessary to do the assignment with a focus on the parallel programming. 

I am excited by this change as I feel it will open up the course to students across the university.  Please let me know if you have any comments, questions or concerns,

Take care,

- Dirk

# January 20, 2021 - First Day of class

Hello CMSE401 Students,

It was great to see all of you in class today.  Sorry for spending most of the time talking. In the future I hope to spend most of our time programming, going though examples and answering your questions.  Each day I will try to record a video of class and post it on the course website: [http://cmse.msu.edu/cmse401](http://cmse.msu.edu/cmse401).  As best I can I will also try to break up the video based on topis as I think this makes it easier for you to find things.  Todays videos are as follows:

## [Welcome to CMSE401 overview](https://youtu.be/wePwHmb1Ngo)

## [Pre-class Questions](https://youtu.be/40lQUb-zzxU)

- Ondemand questions
- Cloning repository questions
- HPC Questions


## [HW1 Overview](https://youtu.be/xqcIwLyWhVM)

## [Project Proposal](https://youtu.be/FLpsg_4zmig)

## [Serial Pandemic Example](https://youtu.be/s5ssqQD05tY)

Hope you find these videos useful,

# January 11, 2021 - Week 1 Assignment Correction/Clarification

Hello CMSE401 Students,

Sorry for the confusion but after sending out my previous email I learned that, per the new COVID policy, instructors are NOT allowed to assign any required work during the review week (January 11th-15th). I now understand that this policy must be in place because there are large groups of students that do not have access to reliable Internet this week.  To be fair and equitable to these students, the  [Class Preparation Checklist](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse401-S21-student/Class_Prep_Checklist) is no longer required and only recommended (I also got the link wrong in my previous email).  

Please email me if you have any comments, questions or concerns.  I am also happy to schedule a zoom or even a phone meeting if anyone would prefer to discuss the class and/or this policy.

Take care,

- Dirk

## Welcome to CMSE401: Methods in Parallel Programming


Hello CMSE401 students,

I am excited to be teaching CMSE401 this Spring and look forward to meeting all of you in class next week. Pleasee see the course website for all information about this course:

* [CMSE401 website](http://cmse.msu.edu/cmse401)

This semester is unique since, due to new university COVID policies, we will not be meeting the first week of class. Instead the first week will be used for reading, review and semester preparation.  To this end, I request that all students complete the pre-semester tasks found on the following website before showing up for the first day of class which will be on **_Wednesday January 20th_**.  

* [Class Preparation Checklist](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse401-S21-student/Class_Prep_Checklist)

I will be holding office hours the first week of class. Please feel free to stop by to just introduce yourself or ask a question about the course or any of the following tasks.  Also, please do not hesitate to contact me at (colbrydi@msu.edu).
