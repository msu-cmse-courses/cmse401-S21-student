# January 31, 2021 - Missing pre-class assignments

Hey Everyone,

I am really sorry that I forgot to post the pre-class assignments on Friday after class.  I was so focused on getting your grades done over the weekend I completely forgot that you did not have your assignments. They are posted now and I will work hard to make sure this does not happen again in the future.

I realize it is late on a Sunday so I will allow late submissions of Monday's pre-class assignment.  Please get it done when you can and fill out the survey.  Let me know if me being late has caused any other problems for you and we can try to find ways to help. 
Take care,

- Dirk

# January 21, 2021 - Prerequisite changes

Hello CMSE401 Students,

I wanted all of you to know that the CMSE "Undergraduate studies committee" has agreed to change the prerequisites for this course.  Now students are only required to have Calculus II (including either MTH 133, the Honors version of calc II and the "Survey of Calculus" class) and a C/C++ course (like CSE232). The course will no longer require Calculus 4.  

Although these changes will not become official until next time CMSE401 is taught, I will be rewriting all of the assignments to reflect these new requirements.  We will continue to use examples that take advantage of multi-variable calculus you learned in Calculus 4 however these examples will not require that you have taken Calculus 4. I will review and cover all of the math necessary to do the assignment with a focus on the parallel programming. 

I am excited by this change as I feel it will open up the course to students across the university.  Please let me know if you have any comments, questions or concerns,

Take care,

- Dirk

# January 20, 2021 - First Day of class

Hello CMSE401 Students,

It was great to see all of you in class today.  Sorry for spending most of the time talking. In the future I hope to spend most of our time programming, going though examples and answering your questions.  Each day I will try to record a video of class and post it on the course website: [http://cmse.msu.edu/cmse401](http://cmse.msu.edu/cmse401).  As best I can I will also try to break up the video based on topis as I think this makes it easier for you to find things.  Todays videos are as follows:

# January 11, 2021 - Week 1 Assignment Correction/Clarification

Hello CMSE401 Students,

Sorry for the confusion but after sending out my previous email I learned that, per the new COVID policy, instructors are NOT allowed to assign any required work during the review week (January 11th-15th). I now understand that this policy must be in place because there are large groups of students that do not have access to reliable Internet this week.  To be fair and equitable to these students, the  [Class Preparation Checklist](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse401-S21-student/Class_Prep_Checklist) is no longer required and only recommended (I also got the link wrong in my previous email).  

Please email me if you have any comments, questions or concerns.  I am also happy to schedule a zoom or even a phone meeting if anyone would prefer to discuss the class and/or this policy.

Take care,

- Dirk

To this end, I request that all students complete the pre-semester tasks found on the following website before showing up for the first day of class which will be on **_Wednesday January 20th_**.  

* [Class Preparation Checklist](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse401-S21-student/Class_Prep_Checklist)

I will be holding office hours the first week of class. Please feel free to stop by to just introduce yourself or ask a question about the course or any of the following tasks.  Also, please do not hesitate to contact me at (colbrydi@msu.edu).
